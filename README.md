# React Array Method Visualizer

## Description

This is a small React app built to visualize the various array methods available.

## Goals

My goal is to build a React app that visualizes array methods. The app is pretty simple, but there's a large amount of state management involved due to the way I want to implement this.

### Roadmap to v1.0.0

**Currently implemented features**


**Version 0.5.0 should have the following done**
- Cards should get the array from the form and then save that as an instance in each Card's state
- Form should allow you to submit or reset the arrays
- Cards should be able to *slowly* update the state of the Card's array while its performing operations

**Version 1.0.0 should have the following done**
- Cards should visualize each step of the specified array method
  - each card should display a separate array method properly
- Cards should be resetable via a button in the form

## Dependencies

This app was built using Facebook's create-react-app npm package.
